# Task 5 – Decision Trees & Random Forests

## Overview
This task demonstrates tree-based machine learning models using the Heart Disease dataset.

## What I Did
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier  
- Visualized the decision tree  
- Tuned max_depth to reduce overfitting  
- Trained a Random Forest and compared accuracy  
- Analyzed feature importance  
- Used cross-validation for evaluation  

## Tools
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Results (Sample)
- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~  
- Tuned Decision Tree Accuracy: ~  
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~  
- Mean CV Accuracy: ~
